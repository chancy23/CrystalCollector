# unit-4-game (Crystal Collector Game)

Player must try to match the Target number by clickiing on the gems, each gem has a randomly assigned value.

If the player matches the target exactly they win, wins will go up by 1, and game will generate a new target number, and reassign the gem values (all random again), and the counter (Your Total section) is cleared.

If the player goes over the target number, they lose, the losses will go up by 1, and the game resets (with random target and gem values), and the counter (Your Total section) is cleared.
